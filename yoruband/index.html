      <p>Consider the very rare nature that you have. As related to your origin. There are 3 major points in one’s life: where you’re from, where you are, and where you’re headed. It is often said that we can’t do the most with where we’re going if we can’t reconcile with where we’re from. So, where you’re from, and your origin can serve you a greater understanding of yourself. There is already great beauty in knowing you are African. There is now richer beauty because of the prestige of your tribal origin. You might consider this site as your closest contact after Wikipedia. As you consider your origin, you will have very typical questions: were we nomads? Did we have a home before we settled in western Africa? Who were the critical figures in leadership? Can I trace my family lineage through this site? Can I find more extensive resources for historical knowledge? Well, we are sure you will get all the information you will need.
