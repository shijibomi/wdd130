      <p>
        Consider the very rare nature that you have. As related to your origin. There are 3 major points in one’s life: where you’re from, where you are, and where you’re headed. It is often said that we can’t do the most with where we’re going if we can’t reconcile with where we’re from. So, where you’re from, and your origin can serve you a greater understanding of yourself. There is already great beauty in knowing you are African. There is now richer beauty because of the prestige of your tribal origin. You might consider this site as your closest contact after Wikipedia. As you consider your origin, you will have very typical questions: were we nomads? Did we have a home before we settled in western Africa? Who were the critical figures in leadership? Can I trace my family lineage through this site? Can I find more extensive resources for historical knowledge? Well, we are sure you will get all the information you will need.

      <h3>Deity and Dates</h3>
      <p>
       From Oduduwa, the deity king, to the demi-gods that remain prominent in folktales, all of these you can learn more about all.  There are over 20 demigods in the Yoruba tribe, whom all serve different purposes and morals. Consider the different states in the southwestern subregion of Nigeria. All 6 states have close relations with these demigods. For instance, Ogun state is known to get its name from the Ogun river, which bares the same name as the Yoruba god of iron. Yes, his name is also Ogun. It’s pretty interesting, isn’t it? This and more await you in your knowledge hunt of history. I am personally excited for all you will come to learn as you consider your heritage. Remember, the people before you play a core part in your earthly life today. Now, I know this is not a black panther movie. Yoruba people don’t yell Wakanda forever. We don’t even know what that is, all thanks to Marvel. What about important historical dates? Can we consider the important days in Yoruba history and all of the details that there lie?  I am certain we can. Let’s look critically into the different wedges of the days before and how they can aid our reconciliation with the past. We shall provide you with these important details. Be sure to share the information you find with family and friends, and provide comments on additional details that you may have. Your feedback plays a big part in the evolution of the information we provide.

      <h3>Kings and Cuisines</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, there are 6 states that make up southwestern Nigeria. All of these 6 are affiliated with the Yoruba tribe. But there are different communities and groups in this subregion. There are about 20 different communities or groups in just one state alone. These people are led by chiefs, or baale’s, and they are led by sectional kings. From the Olubara of Ibara to the Baale of Lafenwa, to the Olowu of Owu, the Oba(king) of Egbaland, and the Ooni of Ife.  There are still so many more of these kings cutting across the whole subregion. We shall also consider, along with these dignitaries, the delicacies that are enjoyed by the Yoruba people. As many and diverse as there are, we may consider the all-time favorites. The sweet leafy efo-riro, ewedu, okro soup, and egusi soup, and the fufu, yams, garri, amala, eba, and plantains. All of these and more are to be considered in the view of delicious delicacies. You will come to fall in love with each of these as you learn the recipes to make them.
