  <p>Nicknames don't stick with me long enough to be known by a lot of people. A blessing pretty much. I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. 
    I love things that cause me to think and seek innovation. I love road trips and trying new foods. Being Nigerian, I have very versatile taste buds. 
    I am currently planning towards changing my marital status. I found the girl. Marriage is, for me, a saving ordinance in every way.
     I'm 24 years old and I've been a member of the church all my life. My life is built around the gospel. This is why I love BYU-Idaho so much.
      I love all of scripture, but I think the epistle of James has had great impact on me.</p>
